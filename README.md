## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will require the following to run the application:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Used for Node Package Manager (NPM) to install application dependencies.
- Git - To clone the project

### Installing

1. Clone the project into your chosen directory with:
    ```

    ```
2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project (/waffle_admin/) and run the following command:
    ```
